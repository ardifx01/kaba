# Kaba Programming Language

Kaba is a strong and statically-typed programming language.

It is written in Rust and currently under active development.

## 📦 Install

You can download the specific version you want to use directly from our [releases page](https://github.com/snaztoz/kaba/releases), and then unzip the binary.

If you want to build Kaba from source, consult the ["Building Kaba" guide](docs/build.md).

## 🚀 Usage

First, [install](#-install) or [build](docs/build.md) Kaba binary.

Then create a [Kaba program file](docs/features.md) (the extension **must be** `.kaba`). Let's say that we name it `count.kaba`.

Run the following command:

```bash
kaba run count.kaba
```

## ❓ Features

See [features](docs/features.md) page to learn about all available features.

## 🤔 Example

See [docs/examples](docs/examples) directory for the examples of already-working Kaba programs.

## 🎯 Next Goals

Current priority is to add support for other data types, such as array and string.
