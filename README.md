# Kaba Language

The repository for Kaba programming language.

The languages I took for the inspirations of this project are Java and PHP, but I want to make it with better features, such as no null reference, better type system than PHP, etc.

## Build

Make sure that Rust and its toolchains (such as Cargo) are installed (see [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions).

If you want to try using the language instantly, use:
```bash
cargo run -- <file-name>
```

If you want to build the binary in release mode, use:
```bash
# Compile once
cargo build --release

./target/release/kaba <file-name>
```

## Usage

Usage instructions:

1. Create a source code file (the extension **must be** `.kaba`).

2. Run:
  ```bash
  kaba <file-nama>
  ```

## Features

As this is a really new project, it only has limited features for now:

1. Variable creation (currently integer only)
  ```text
  var x = 15;
  ```

2. Value re-assign (Again, integer only for the time being)
  ```text
  var x = 20;
  x = 999;
  ```

3. Basic arithmetic operation (Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction)
  ```text
  23 + 5 * 30 / 2 - 9
  ```

4. Grouped expression
  ```text
  52 * (2 + 3) / 3
  ```

5. `print` function (there is no other function, and it is not yet supported to create a new one)
  ```text
  var x = 101;

  print(x);
  ```

## Example

Program for variable swapping:
```text
var x = 10;
var y = 20;

print(x);
print(y);

var temp = x;
x = y;
y = temp;

print(x);
print(y);
```

## Next Goals

Current priority:
1. Better error handling.
2. Control flow support (such as `if-else` and loop).
3. Support for other data types, such as float and string.

## Attention

1. All statements must be terminated with semicolon (`;`).
2. There is no garbage collector yet, so don't create too many variables for nowðŸ¤£.
