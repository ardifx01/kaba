## Note on the runtime...

The runtime implementation is currently only serves as a prototype to demonstrate the language features of Kaba, so there may be **a lot** of non-efficient code.

The main focus at the moment is in making a working (and correct) compiler first.

In the future, Kaba runtime should works on bytecode instructions instead, and not using the AST directly anymore.
