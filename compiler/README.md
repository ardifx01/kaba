# Kaba Language Compiler

This library implements the compiler for Kaba programming language.

## How it works?

The compilation process itself undergoes multiple steps:

### Lexing / Tokenizing

Lexing is a process that turns program source code into a series of tokens.

For example, this expression:

```txt
1 + abc * 5;
```

Will be turned into:

```txt
[Integer(1), Add, Identifier("abc"), Mul, Integer(5)]
```

The compiler currently uses [Logos](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos) to implement lexing process.

### Parsing

Parsing stage will turns an array of tokens into an abstract-syntax tree (AST).

For example, using the previous produced tokens by the lexer, the constructed AST will resembles something like this:

```txt
Add {
    lhs: Integer(1),
    rhs: Mul {
        lhs: Identifier("abc"),
        rhs: Integer(5)
    }
}
```

or visually:

```txt
            Add
           /   \
  Integer(1)    Mul
               /   \
Identifier("abc")  Integer(5)
```

Operator precedences will also be handled during this stage.

The parser used by the compiler is implemented using a hand-written [recursive-descent parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) technique.

### Semantic Checking

This stage will catch all the *nonsenses* found in the AST.

For example, the following program:

```txt
5 + false;
```

... is valid according to the syntax of Kaba language, but it will be marked as invalid by the semantic checker as it does not make sense to add a number with a boolean (not in Kaba, at leastðŸ˜‰).

This part is also implemented manually (hand-written).
