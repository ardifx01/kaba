# Kaba Language

The repository for Kaba programming language.

The languages I took for the inspirations of this project are Java and PHP, but I want to make it with better features, such as no null reference, better type system than PHP, etc.

## üì¶ Install

You can download the specific version you want to use from our [releases page](https://github.com/snaztoz/kaba/releases), and then unzip it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

If you want to build the executable from source, follow the following build instructions.

Make sure that Rust and its toolchains (such as Cargo) are installed (see [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions).

If you want to try using the language instantly, use:
```bash
cargo run -- run <file-name>
```

If you want to build the binary first in release mode, use:
```bash
# Compile once
cargo build --release

./target/release/kaba run <file-name>
```

If you want to run all tests, use:
```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

## üöÄ Usage

Usage instructions:

1. Install or build Kaba.

2. Create a source code file (the extension **must be** `.kaba`). Let's say that we name it `count.kaba`.

3. Run:
  ```bash
  kaba run count.kaba
  ```

## ‚ùì Features

Currently, Kaba only has the limited features for now:

* Defining functions
  ```text
  fn main() do
    debug return_two();
  end

  fn return_two(): Int do
    return 2;
  end
  ```

(The next examples are assumed to be reside inside `main()` function)

* Comments
  ```text
  # This is a comment.
  #
  # It will be ignored.
  ```

* Variable creation
  ```text
  var x = 15;
  ```

* Support for integer, float and boolean
  ```text
  var a = 5;
  var b = 10.7;
  var c = -(999);
  var d = true;
  ```

* Value assignments
  ```text
  var x = 20;
  x = 999;

  # Shorthands are also supported:
  x += 1;
  x -= 0;
  x *= 2;
  x /= 4;
  x %= 2;

  # This will trigger error due to the types are being incompatible:
  var i = 5.0;
  i = 7;
  ```

* Support for type notation
  ```text
  var x: Float = 5;

  # This will trigger error
  var i: Int = 5.0;
  ```

* Support for function type notation
  ```text
  # Let's say that `foo` is something like:
  #
  #   fn foo(): Int do
  #     return 20;
  #   end
  #

  var x: () -> Int = foo;
  debug x();

  # Or, it can be automatically inferred as well:

  var y = foo;
  debug y();
  ```

* Basic math operation (division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, and modulo)
  ```text
  23 + 5 * 30 / 2 - 9;

  5 % 2;
  ```

* Equality and comparison operation
  ```text
  50 == 50;
  50 != 10;
  43 > 2;
  2.5 >= 2.5;
  100 < 101;
  7 <= 10;
  ```

* Logical operation
  ```text
  false || true;  # true
  false && false; # false
  !false;         # true
  ```

* Grouped expression
  ```text
  52 * (2 + 3) / 3;
  ```

* `debug` statement to output value to console
  ```text
  var x = 101;

  debug x;
  ```

* Conditional branch
  ```text
  var condition = 50 > 10;
  var condition2 = 50 > 20;

  if condition do
    debug 1;
    if condition2 do
      debug 2;
    end
  else do
    debug 0;
  end
  ```

* Loop
  ```
  var i = 0;

  while i < 10 do
    if i % 2 == 0 do
      debug i;
    end
    i += 1;
  end

  # `Break` and `continue` statements are also supported
  while true do
    break;
  end
  ```

## ü§î Example

* Program for variable swapping:
  ```text
  fn main() do
    var x = 10;
    var y = 20;

    debug x;
    debug y;

    var temp = x;
    x = y;
    y = temp;

    debug x;
    debug y;
  end
  ```

* Program to print all odd numbers below 10:
  ```text
  fn main() do
    var i = 0;

    while i < 10 do
      if i % 2 == 1 do
        debug i;
      end
      i += 1;
    end
  end
  ```

* Simple fibonacci
  ```text
  fn main() do
    debug fibonacci(6); # This should print "8"
  end

  fn fibonacci(n: Int): Int do
    if n <= 0 do
      return 0;
    else if n == 1 || n == 2 do
      return 1;
    end
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
  end
  ```

## üéØ Next Goals

Current priorities:

* Support for other data types, such as array and string.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention

* All statements must be terminated with either a semicolon (`;`) or `end` keyword (in case of body blocks).
