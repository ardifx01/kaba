# Kaba Language

The repository for Kaba programming language.

The languages I took for the inspirations of this project are Java and PHP, but I want to make it with better features, such as no null reference, better type system than PHP, etc.

## üì¶ Install

You can download the specific version you want to use from our [releases page](https://github.com/snaztoz/kaba/releases), and then unzip it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

If you want to build the executable from source, follow the following build instructions.

Make sure that Rust and its toolchains (such as Cargo) are installed (see [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions).

If you want to try using the language instantly, use:
```bash
cargo run -- run <file-name>
```

If you want to build the binary first in release mode, use:
```bash
# Compile once
cargo build --release

./target/release/kaba run <file-name>
```

If you want to run all tests, use:
```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

## üöÄ Usage

Usage instructions:

1. Install or build Kaba.

2. Create a source code file (the extension **must be** `.kaba`). Let's say that we name it `count.kaba`.

3. Run:
  ```bash
  kaba run count.kaba
  ```

## ‚ùì Features

As this is a really new project, it only has limited features for now:

* Comments
  ```text
  # This is a comment.
  #
  # It will be ignored.
  ```

* Variable creation
  ```text
  var x = 15;
  ```

* Support for integer, float and boolean
  ```text
  var a = 5;
  var b = 10.7;
  var c = -(999);
  var d = true;
  ```

* Value assignments
  ```text
  var x = 20;
  x = 999;

  # Shorthands are also supported:
  x += 1;
  x -= 0;
  x *= 2;
  x /= 4;
  x %= 2;

  # This will trigger error due to the types are being incompatible:
  var i = 5.0;
  i = 7;
  ```

* Support for type notation
  ```text
  var x: Float = 5;

  # This will trigger error
  var i: Int = 5.0;
  ```

* Basic math operation (division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, and modulo)
  ```text
  23 + 5 * 30 / 2 - 9;

  5 % 2;
  ```

* Equality and comparison operation
  ```text
  50 == 50;
  50 != 10;
  43 > 2;
  2.5 >= 2.5;
  100 < 101;
  7 <= 10;
  ```

* Logical operation
  ```text
  false || true;  # true
  false && false; # false
  !false;         # true
  ```

* Grouped expression
  ```text
  52 * (2 + 3) / 3;
  ```

* `print` function (there is no other function, and it is not yet supported to create a new one)
  ```text
  var x = 101;

  print(x);
  ```

* Conditional branch
  ```text
  var condition = 50 > 10;
  var condition2 = 50 > 20;

  if condition {
    print(1);
    if condition2 {
      print(2);
    }
  } else {
    print(0);
  }
  ```

* Loop
  ```
  var i = 0;

  while i < 10 {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
      print(i);
    }
    i += 1;
  }

  # `Break` and `continue` statements are also supported
  while true {
    break;
  }
  ```

## ü§î Example

* Program for variable swapping:
  ```text
  var x = 10;
  var y = 20;

  print(x);
  print(y);

  var temp = x;
  x = y;
  y = temp;

  print(x);
  print(y);
  ```

* Program to print all odd numbers below 10:
  ```text
  var i = 0;

  while i < 10 {
    if i % 2 == 1 {
      print(i);
    }
    i += 1;
  }
  ```

## üéØ Next Goals

Current priorities:

* Better type system.
* Support for function definition.
* Support for other data types, such as array and string.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention

* All statements must be terminated with either a semicolon (`;`) or right brace (`}`) (in case of body blocks).
